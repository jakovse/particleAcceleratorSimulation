To run the result of the excercise you need to clone this repository and then first run on ParticleAcceleratorSimulation.jar file. This runnable jar activates monitoring and archiving services and 
starts "measuring". The archiving service archives all the data and stores it in a .txt file according to timestamp. Then any number of OperatorClient.jar runnable files can be run. 
They serve as an OperatorClient service where the user can see the values of sensors and the overall status of the particle accelerator. Unfortunately the optional task was not completed.
